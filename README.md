## Hello World 👋
I'm **Danny Vanpoucke**, a computational materials scientist at the [Instute for Materials Research (IMO-IMOMEC)](https://www.uhasselt.be/en/instituten-en/imo-imomec) at [UHasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/en/), Belgium. With PhDs 👨‍🎓 in Materials Physics (2005) from the University of Twente and Theoretical Chemistry (2009) from Ghent University, I'm delocalized between physics⚛️, chemistry🧪 and computer science 💻.

Since Oktober 2022, I'm a tenure track professor at Hasselt University, where I teach courses in computational materials research🧙‍♂️💻 for the [master in materiomics program](https://www.uhasselt.be/nl/studeren/opleidingen/master-in-materiomics), going from *ab initio* quantum mechanical modeling to Machine Learning. My [QuATOMs group](https://dannyvanpoucke.be/quatoms-group/)  works on materials related topics centered around three pillars: (1) Density Functional Modeling of materials⚛️, (2) the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 🤖 for small data sets, and (3) the elucidation of experimental observations through theoretical-experimental collaborations👯.

As you may gather from the above, I'm enthousiastic about computational modelling and hope to transfer some of that enthousiasm to my students, showing them anything is possible in a virtual lab 🥼💻. Up-to-date information can be found
