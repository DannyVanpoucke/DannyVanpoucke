## Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Danny Vanpoucke**, a computational materials scientist at the Instute for Materials Research (IMO-IMOMEC) at UHasselt, Belgium. With PhDs in Materials Physics (2005) from the University of Twente and Theoretical Chemistry (2009) from Ghent University, I feel delocalized between physics, chemistry and computer science.

Since Oktober 2022, I'm a tenure track professor at Hasselt University, where I teach courses in computational materials research for the master in materiomics program, going from *ab initio* quantum mechanical modeling to Machine Learning. My QuATOMs research team works on materials related topics centered around three pillars: (1) Density Functional Modeling of materials, (2) the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for small data sets, and (3) the elucidation of experimental observations through theoretical-experimental collaborations.
